# Strategy pattern

* Is a _behavioral design pattern_
* Lets you define a family of algorithms (the behaviors), placing them in a separate class
* These behaviors are _interchangeable_


### In this example, I'm using this pattern on the payment method, allowing the user to choose one and usign it
Regardless of the method selected, the call to pay _will be the same_ : `cart.pay(paymentMethod)`.
